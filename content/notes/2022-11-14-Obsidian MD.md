Today I would like to introduce you to a software that I have been very enthusiastic about for some time.
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is for easy archiving and organization of notes. These notes are created as simple markdown files. They are easy to search and can be linked together in folders, by keywords or by bi-directional links. The software is simple and has a tidy interface that you can get to grips with very quickly.


In addition, the software can be adapted to special requirements using a large number of community plugins. Then suddenly to-do lists, kanban boards and flip cards can be used. There are hardly any limits to the fantasy here.

I am excited about this tool because, I have the impression that a long search for a good personal knowledge base has finally come to an end. I've tried countless tools in the past. Including Evernote, OneNote, Lotus Organizer and many more. But so far, there was no tool that seemed as handy as Obsidian.

The software is free and works on a wide variety of platforms. It doesn't matter whether you want to use it to organize pen-and-paper role-playing games, save recipes or even learn a new language. Obsidian can be helpful in so many cases. 

Just try it.
